# PreferencePicker
The idea is that you give the app a set of things: an itunes playlist, or a group of books, or images, or whatever. The app then presents you with a choice between two of the items in the list, and asks you to pick the one that you prefer between the two. You repeat this choosing game over time. As you play, the app builds an ordered list of your preferences across the set of things.
So you wonder, I read a lot of books in 2015, I wonder which ones were my favorites? Or, I have all the Beatles songs and I really like the Beatles, but I'm not sure which are my most favorite. The app will help you investigate that, and share or export the results.
