# PreferencePicker
Preference Picker informs you about your favorite things. You import a set of similar things: right now a Music playlist from your Music app, or a Moment from your Photos app.The app then presents you with a choice between two of the items in the list, and asks you to pick the one that you prefer between the two, like a game. You repeat this choosing game over time. As you play, the app builds an ordered, weighted list of your preferences across the set of things, using an ELO rating system like the one used around the world to rank chess players, or the ones that back Nate Silver's work at fivethirtyeight.com

PreferencePicker is a powerful, flexible engine for ordering and grouping preferences in a mathematically sound way.

It is easy to expand the engine to support additional kinds of sets.

It would be easy to expand the engine to crowd-source preferences across groups of people: useful for social scientists or marketers alike.

The engine persists in Core Data currently and has been designed to easily accommodate other persistence mechanisms.
